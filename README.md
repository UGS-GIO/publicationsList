# Geologic-Index-Maps - UGS Geologic Index Maps
These applications (which used to pull all of their data from an AGOL-hosted feature service), now pulls only the geography from an AGOL feature service and uses the series_id to make a dynamic join with mySQL. 

One application is custom-built for our bookstore's website (iframe of https://geology.utah.gov/apps/geoindex/bookstore-geomaps.html on https://www.utahmapstore.com/pages/geologic-map-selector).

The other application is embedded into WordPress as an HTML code-block with javaScript and PHP put into head box. The testing code is hosted here: https://geology.utah.gov/apps/geoindex/index4.5mySQL.html
