# publicationsList - UGS Dynamic Publications List
This applications (which used to be represented on the UGS website in multiple ways; static, jqWidgets) uses DataTables to dynamically show all (or filtered) UGS publications. It is in the development phase right now, and in the future will be used to replace the static list of maps here (https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/maps/geologic-maps/), the publications repository page here (https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/publications/#), and will be used in many category-specific pages that need publication lists. 

The testing page is here: https://geology.utah.gov/apps/publications/geolmapfilter.php
